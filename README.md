### 💬 About Me:
```
I am a meticulous data professional with 4+ years of experiences.
I loved to get dirty to translate raw messy data into actionable insights.
On daily basis I am working using SQL, Python and Presentation Decs.

Currently working in Kitabisa.com, the biggest social crowdfunding company in Indonesia.
Previously worked in Gojek, a Decacorn startup in SEA.
My skills & experience span across Fintech, Insuretech, Crowdfunding, and Ride-Hailing products/verticals.

I love read some books and binge watch some detective series on Netflix (sometimes K-Drama too)
```


🌱 I’m currently working on in updating and cleaning up my github repository and start writing a blog
